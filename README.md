Link to demo of this site is [here](https://kowalchick.github.io/Workshop1_website)

## Short Description of my work

This website is a task I was doing on bootcamp JavaScrip Developer after the first week of my study.

The page is based only on simple HTML and CSS code. Nothings else. More advanced pages are comming soon (with my progress on the course).

All guidelines I received from my school are based on Adobe XD project and are available [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/31804ad0-5f57-46e0-6edf-a5f54c37078a-47b1/grid/). 
I added a small features of mine to this layout. 

All works I needed to do on my own starting from scratch. It was a workshop number one. 


Enjoy!
