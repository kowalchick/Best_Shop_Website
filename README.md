## Short Description of my work

This website is a task I was doing on bootcamp JavaScrip Developer after the first week of my study.

All guidelines I received from my school are based on Adobe XD project and are available [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/31804ad0-5f57-46e0-6edf-a5f54c37078a-47b1/grid/).

All works I needed to do on my own starting from scratch. It was a workshop number one. 


Enjoy!
